# khive — Agent Usage Guide

This file is for AI agents (and the humans configuring them) using khive as the research runtime.

khive gives your agent:

1. **A knowledge graph** — typed entities + edges you build as you work
2. **Notes** — observations, insights, questions, decisions, references that persist across sessions
3. **Pattern matching queries** — GQL/SPARQL traverse over the graph
4. **Task management** — GTD lifecycle (inbox → next → active → done)
5. **Memory** — salience- and decay-weighted recall across sessions
6. **Communication** — namespaced message passing between agents
7. **Scheduling** — time-triggered reminders and future verb dispatch
8. **Knowledge corpus** — atom/domain CRUD, FTS + embedding search, compose briefings
9. **Brain** — Bayesian profile tuning from feedback signals

All 7 packs load by default. **63 public verbs** across the packs.

If you're working on khive itself (writing code in this repo), see `CLAUDE.md` instead.

## Core verbs

All verbs are dispatched through a single MCP tool, `request`, which accepts a function-call DSL
or JSON form ([ADR-016](docs/adr/ADR-016-request-dsl.md),
[ADR-027](docs/adr/ADR-027-single-tool-mcp-surface.md)). Verb semantics and namespace contract are
defined in [ADR-023](docs/adr/ADR-023-declarative-pack-format.md).

### KG pack — 16 verbs (bare names, no prefix)

| Verb        | What it does                                     | When to use                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`    | Add an entity or note                            | New concept, paper, observation, decision worth tracking |
| `get`       | Fetch any record by UUID (auto-detects type)     | When you have a UUID and need the full record            |
| `search`    | Text + semantic search over entities or notes    | Finding things by content similarity                     |
| `list`      | Structured filtering (by kind, tags, etc.)       | Browsing a category or namespace                         |
| `stats`     | Entity/edge/note/event counts                    | Dashboard, health check                                  |
| `update`    | Patch properties, tags, or content (by UUID)     | Correcting or enriching an existing record               |
| `delete`    | Soft-delete (or hard-delete) a record (by UUID)  | Removing stale or incorrect data                         |
| `merge`     | Deduplicate two entities into one                | "LoRA" and "Low-Rank Adaptation" are the same concept    |
| `link`      | Connect two nodes with a typed relation          | When relationships emerge from research                  |
| `neighbors` | Immediate neighbors of a node                    | "What connects to this entity?"                          |
| `traverse`  | Multi-hop graph walk with depth/relation filters | Structural context — lineages, paths, clusters           |
| `query`     | GQL/SPARQL query string → SQL                    | Complex pattern matching over the graph                  |
| `propose`   | Create an event-sourced change proposal          | Staging changes for review before apply                  |
| `review`    | Approve or reject a proposal                     | Gating changes through a review workflow                 |
| `withdraw`  | Cancel an open proposal                          | Abandoning a staged change                               |
| `verbs`     | List all registered verbs on this server         | Discovery — see what's available                         |

`get`, `update`, `delete` are UUID-only — they auto-detect whether the record is an entity, note,
or edge. `create`, `list`, `search` require `kind=entity|note` (or `kind=edge` for `list`;
`kind=event` for audit events per [ADR-038](docs/adr/ADR-038-events-surface.md)).

`knowledge.search` supports `decompose=true` for multi-concept query splitting (avoids FTS edge
cases). Scores are normalized to [0,1] when `rerank` is active (default).

### How to call a verb

Wrap the verb call in `request(ops="…")`:

```text
request(ops="create(kind=\"entity\", entity_kind=\"concept\", name=\"LoRA\")")
request(ops="search(kind=\"entity\", query=\"memory efficient attention\")")
request(ops="link(source_id=\"<u>\", target_id=\"<v>\", relation=\"extends\", weight=0.9)")
```

Run several ops in parallel by passing a batch:

```text
request(ops="[create(kind=\"entity\", entity_kind=\"concept\", name=\"A\"), create(kind=\"entity\", entity_kind=\"concept\", name=\"B\")]")
```

JSON form is equivalent (use this when the DSL string would be hard to escape):

```text
request(ops="[{\"tool\":\"create\",\"args\":{\"kind\":\"entity\",\"entity_kind\":\"concept\",\"name\":\"LoRA\"}}]")
```

Ops in a batch run in parallel and have no ordering guarantee. If op B depends on op A's output
(e.g. create-then-link), use two `request` calls.

**Deferred (not yet available):**

- `create(supersedes=<old-id>)` parameter shortcut — this convenience form (which would atomically
  create a new record and add a `supersedes` edge to the old one) is not yet in the wire surface.
  Use the two-step approach: `create(...)` then `link(..., relation="supersedes")`.
- Note merge — only entity merge is implemented (`merge(into_id=..., from_id=...)`).
  Deduplicating two notes is not yet supported; add a `supersedes` edge manually.

### Notes vs entities

- **Entities** = things in the world: concepts, papers, people, projects, datasets, orgs,
  artifacts, services. Graph nodes with typed edges between them.
- **Notes** = your observations about the world: what you noticed, concluded, decided, asked, cited.
  Temporal records with salience and optional graph edges (via `annotates`).

Use `create(kind="entity", entity_kind="concept", ...)` for entities.
Use `create(kind="note", note_kind="observation", ...)` for notes.

## The 8 entity kinds (closed set — [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-entity-kind-taxonomy.md))

| Kind       | What it represents                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept`  | Algorithms, techniques, architectures, theories, models |
| `document` | Papers, preprints, technical reports, blog posts, books |
| `dataset`  | Benchmarks, corpora, evaluation sets                    |
| `project`  | Codebases, libraries, tools, frameworks                 |
| `person`   | Researchers, engineers, authors                         |
| `org`      | Labs, companies, institutions                           |
| `artifact` | Binaries, model checkpoints, Docker images, packages    |
| `service`  | APIs, hosted endpoints, SaaS products                   |

`concept` is the default. Use `properties` for finer distinctions (`type: "paper"`,
`domain: "attention"`, `status: "implemented"`).

---

## The 5 note kinds (closed set — [ADR-013](docs/adr/ADR-013-note-kind-taxonomy.md))

| Kind          | What it records                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `observation` | An empirical capture — what you noticed       |
| `insight`     | A synthetic conclusion from observations      |
| `question`    | An open inquiry or research direction         |
| `decision`    | A committed choice with rationale             |
| `reference`   | An external pointer with context (paper, URL) |

`observation` is the default. Notes can annotate entities via `create(kind="note",
annotates=[entity_id], ...)`.

---

## The 15-relation ontology (closed set — [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-edge-ontology.md))

When you `link` nodes, use ONLY these relations:

### Structure

- `contains` — parent → child (system contains module)
- `part_of` — inverse of contains
- `instance_of` — specific is a case of general

### Derivation

- `extends` — child builds on parent (Flash Causal extends Flash Tiled)
- `variant_of` — A is a modified version of B (QLoRA variant_of LoRA)
- `introduced_by` — concept first described in paper/by person
- `supersedes` — new replaces old entirely

### Provenance

- `derived_from` — output derived from input (artifact from dataset, document, etc.)

### Temporal

- `precedes` — earlier comes before later (document → document, dataset → dataset, etc.)

### Dependency

- `depends_on` — consumer needs dependency at runtime/build
- `enables` — prerequisite makes outcome possible

### Implementation

- `implements` — code realizes algorithm/concept

### Lateral

- `competes_with` — alternative approaches
- `composed_with` — used together in a system

### Annotation

- `annotates` — a note observes/comments on an entity (or another note)

**Why closed**: a sparse ontology stays queryable. Ad-hoc relations (`uses`, `related_to`,
`loaded_by`) fragment the graph and make traversal useless. If your relationship doesn't fit, it's
probably a property on the entity, not an edge.

## Tool schemas (required → **bold**, optional → normal)

These are the KG pack verbs. Other packs are documented in their verb tables above.

### When to use which retrieval verb

- **`get(id)`** — you have a UUID, fetch the record (any type)
- **`search(kind, query)`** — text similarity: "find things _about_ X"
- **`list(kind, filters)`** — structured browse: "all concepts" / "edges from node A"
- **`neighbors(node_id)`** — one-hop graph: "what connects to X?"
- **`traverse(roots)`** — multi-hop graph: "reachability within N hops"
- **`query(gql)`** — pattern matching: "concepts that extend something introduced by a paper"

### Supersession via edges

To supersede a record, create a `supersedes` edge:

```
request(ops="link(source_id=\"<new_note>\", target_id=\"<old_note>\", relation=\"supersedes\")")
```

`search(kind="note")` already excludes notes targeted by a `supersedes` edge (implemented in
`khive_runtime::operations::search_notes`, per ADR-024 §"Filter superseded notes" step 5). That
exclusion is a **view-layer filter**: superseding **keeps** the old note and its edges and
marks it superseded; it never deletes, copies, or transfers anything. "Show only current" is a
query concern. See CLAUDE.md §"Data vs. view — the principle most violated here" before
implementing any supersede / annotate / currency behavior.

---

## Research workflow pattern

Each step below is run as `request(ops="<verb_call>")`. The inner verb syntax is shown for
brevity — wrap it in `request(...)` when calling MCP.

```
1. search(kind="note", query="topic I'm investigating")
   → see what you already know

2. search(kind="entity", query="FlashAttention")
   → check what's already in the graph

3. For new concepts:
   create(kind="entity", entity_kind="concept", name="...", properties={...})

4. For relationships:
   link(source_id="<A>", target_id="<B>", relation="extends")

5. For observations/insights:
   create(kind="note", note_kind="observation", content="...", annotates=["<entity_id>"])

6. For structural queries:
   traverse(roots=["<entity_id>"], max_depth=3, relations=["extends", "variant_of"])
```

Independent ops can be batched in one call:

```
request(ops="[search(kind=\"entity\", query=\"LoRA\"), search(kind=\"note\", query=\"LoRA\")]")
```

## Entity naming conventions

- **Short canonical names**, not full titles: `LoRA` not
  `Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models`
- **Papers**: entity name = short name (`Sinkhorn Distances`). Full title, authors, year, arxiv ID
  in `properties`
- **Algorithms**: the name people actually say: `GQA`, `RoPE`, `FlashAttention`
- **No prefixes/suffixes**: `Speculative Decoding` not `Speculative Decoding (concept)`

---

## Property conventions

Use these canonical property keys when applicable:

| Key       | Values                                                                                     | Purpose                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `type`    | `paper`, `algorithm`, `technique`, `architecture`, `model`, `benchmark`, `dataset`, `tool` | Finer classification than `kind` |
| `domain`  | `attention`, `inference`, `training`, `fine-tuning`, `optimal-transport`, etc.             | Research area                    |
| `status`  | `concept`, `researched`, `prototyped`, `implemented`, `shipped`, `deprecated`              | Maturity                         |
| `source`  | `arxiv:2106.09685` or DOI/URL                                                              | Citation pointer                 |
| `summary` | One-paragraph description                                                                  | Human-readable explanation       |

For papers also include: `title`, `authors`, `year`.

---

## Edge density rules

Sparse graphs are useless. Every entity should have minimum edges:

| Entity kind                | Min edges | Required relations                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `concept` (algorithm)      | 4         | `instance_of` or `extends` (at least one parent), `introduced_by` if paper exists, `competes_with` if alternatives exist |
| `concept` (paper)          | 2         | `introduced_by` from concepts it introduced                                                                              |
| `project` (implementation) | 3         | `contains` or `part_of`, `implements` (what concept), `depends_on`                                                       |
| `person`                   | 1         | `introduced_by` from their work                                                                                          |

**Target**: 5+ edges per entity average. Below 3 = polish needed.

## GQL traverse examples

```gql
# What does LoRA derive from / what derives from LoRA?
MATCH (a)-[:extends|variant_of*1..3]->(b {name: 'LoRA'}) RETURN a, b

# Find all papers in the attention domain
MATCH (a:concept) WHERE a.domain = 'attention' AND a.type = 'paper' RETURN a

# What concepts does this implementation realize?
MATCH ({name: 'lattice-inference'})-[:implements]->(c:concept) RETURN c

# Multi-hop lineage: from a paper to current implementations
MATCH (p:concept)<-[:introduced_by]-(c)<-[:implements]-(impl)
WHERE p.name = 'Attention Is All You Need'
RETURN c, impl
```

## SPARQL traverse examples

```sparql
# Same as first GQL example, SPARQL syntax
SELECT ?a ?b WHERE { ?a :extends+ ?b . ?b :name 'LoRA' . } LIMIT 10

# Find concepts in a specific domain
SELECT ?a WHERE { ?a a :concept . ?a :domain 'attention' . } LIMIT 20
```

Both syntaxes compile to the same SQL. Use whichever is natural.

## Self-expansion: let the graph grow with your work

khive isn't a passive database — it's designed for the graph to grow as you research:

- **Extract**: feed papers in, entities + edges fall out automatically
- **Gap detection**: traverse finds structural holes — "these clusters should connect"
- **Frontier discovery**: identify leaf nodes worth exploring next
- **Annotate**: notes attach observations to entities, creating cross-substrate navigation

Don't think of yourself as a curator. Think of yourself as a researcher whose work happens to leave
structural traces.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                                           | Why it's wrong                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Storing findings only as notes, never as entities | Notes are for context; entities are for structure  |
| Creating duplicate entities                       | Always `search` first — link to existing if found  |
| Using ad-hoc relations                            | Map to the closed 15-relation set or don't link    |
| Reversed `introduced_by` direction                | concept → paper (the paper introduces the concept) |
| One-hop neighbor queries when you need lineage    | Use `traverse` with `max_depth` for multi-hop      |
| Adding `version`/`date` to entity names           | Those are properties, not names                    |

---

## AI-assisted contribution policy

If you are an AI agent authoring PRs, issues, or comments via someone's CLI:

1. **Attribution**: start the body with a blockquote attribution line:
   `> _PR description authored by Claude (Anthropic agent) on behalf of @<handle>._`
2. **Verify claims**: every claim in your PR description must match the actual diff.
3. **Test evidence**: include `cargo test` output for behavior-changing code.
4. **ADR awareness**: link to relevant ADRs. Schema/interface changes require an ADR first.

---

## Daemon and warm startup

khive-mcp auto-spawns a background daemon (`khive-mcp --daemon`) on the first request. The daemon
keeps the ANN index and embedding model warm so `knowledge.search` and `memory.recall` are fast on
subsequent calls. Users do not need to configure or manage the daemon — it starts automatically and
cleans up on exit.

The daemon communicates over a Unix socket (`khived.sock`). If you see stale-process errors after a
rebuild, kill zombie processes: `pkill -f khive-mcp` then reconnect.

---

## Namespace isolation

Every ID-based operation (`get`, `update`, `delete`, `merge`) verifies that the record belongs to
the caller's namespace at the runtime layer. Storage is ID-only by design; the runtime is the trust
boundary. Cross-namespace access is denied.

---

## Admin tooling

**kkernel** is an optional admin CLI for operators. It provides pack introspection, reindexing, and
engine management commands (`kkernel sync`, `kkernel vector`). Agents do not need kkernel — all
agent-facing operations go through the `request` tool.
