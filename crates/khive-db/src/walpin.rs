//! ADR-091 Amendment 2 Plank B: cross-process WAL-pin attribution sidecar.
//!
//! Every `kkernel mcp` process (daemon or session, any supported platform)
//! that observes its own `tx_registry` oldest span exceed `KHIVE_TX_WARN_SECS`
//! writes a per-PID heartbeat file under `<db-file>.walpin/<pid>.json`. On a
//! TRUNCATE no-progress event, the daemon enumerates this directory and
//! applies a three-test liveness gate (PID alive, `started_at` matches the
//! OS-reported process start time, `updated_at` fresh) to attribute the WAL
//! pin to a specific process rather than only naming its own in-process
//! registry.
//!
//! Filesystem trust boundary (binding): the sidecar
//! directory is created mode 0700 and validated as owned by the current user
//! before any use — a non-compliant existing directory is refused, never
//! chmod/chown'd into compliance. Heartbeat writes go through exclusive
//! create with `O_NOFOLLOW` semantics to a temp file, then atomic rename over
//! the target. Enumeration refuses symlinks and validates per-entry ownership
//! before reading or deleting anything.
//!
//! **Platform split.** Only the write path
//! (`ensure_sidecar_dir`/`write_heartbeat`/`write_beacon`/`remove_heartbeat`/
//! `touch_beacon`) and the identity primitives (`is_process_alive`/
//! `process_start_time_secs`) need to run on every platform — a Windows
//! session still needs to report itself into the sidecar. Directory
//! enumeration (`enumerate_live`/`housekeep_live`, and the OS-derived holder
//! census they anchor to) is Unix-only: its sole caller is the daemon's checkpoint task,
//! and daemon mode itself requires Unix (`khive-mcp/src/serve.rs` refuses
//! `--daemon` on non-Unix). The Unix write path is additionally
//! **handle-bound at every path component**: reaching the sidecar directory
//! walks each component of its parent path with
//! `openat(.., O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW)` relative to the previous
//! descriptor (never a single `open()` on the parent's full path, which
//! only refuses a symlink at the parent's own final component and silently
//! follows every component before it), the directory itself is then
//! validated on the resulting file descriptor, and every
//! create/rename/unlink/enumeration read is performed `*at()`-relative to
//! it — no path is ever re-resolved per operation. The final path
//! component (the sidecar directory's own name, derived from the database
//! file name) is converted to its `openat` argument byte-exact, never via a
//! lossy UTF-8 conversion, since this project supports non-UTF-8 database
//! paths and a lossy conversion could collide two distinct database names
//! onto one sidecar directory. Windows uses a backup-semantics, no-follow
//! directory handle whose `FileAttributeTagInfo` and final resolved path are
//! verified before use. Every child open/create is then rooted at that handle
//! through `NtCreateFile`; rename and deletion remain handle-relative. New
//! directories receive a protected DACL containing one inheritable full-
//! control ACE for their owner, and existing directories with broader ACLs
//! are refused rather than repaired.
