# ADR-181: Exec Verb: One Declared Command in a Sandbox over a Materialized Tree

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2026-09-08
- **Extends**: [ADR-111](ADR-111-blob-store.md) (content-addressed objects; this record adds a tree
  manifest over them), [ADR-180](ADR-180-tool-pack.md) (the policy vocabulary every run is checked
  against)
- **Relates to**: [ADR-108](ADR-108-git-write-surface.md) (git writes take the same tree),
  [ADR-085](ADR-085-code-pack.md) (the code pack ingests and runs nothing; this record is where running
  lives), [ADR-018](ADR-018-authorization-gate.md) (the Gate still runs on every dispatch)

## Context

An agent that develops on khive today still builds and tests through its own shell. Nothing in the
verb set executes a command, so the one step of the loop that must touch a toolchain happens outside
every policy, receipt and sandbox khive has. The blob store holds objects but has no notion of a tree,
so a set of files cannot be named, moved or compared as one thing. The intended posture is an
allow-list: the agent's whole tool set is khive verbs, a command that is not a registered tool does
not exist for it, and the shell exists only inside one verb, over a tree khive materialized, with no
network, no home directory and no credentials.

## Decision

A pack `exec`, requiring `blob` and `tool`. Verb names below are the proposal; the contract tests
written for the loop driver finalize them.

**Tree manifest.** A tree is a blob whose content is `{"schema": "khive-tree/v1", "entries": [{"path",
"ref", "mode"}]}`: `path` is relative, normalized, contains no `..` or absolute component and names no
symlink; `ref` is a blob reference; `mode` is `644` or `755`. `exec.tree(entries)` validates and stores
one and returns its reference; `exec.tree_get(tree)` returns the entries; `exec.tree_diff(base, head)`
lists `added`, `modified` and `deleted` paths with both references. The same manifest is what the git
verbs read and write (ADR-182).

**Run.** `exec.run(tree, tool, args, env, timeout_s, actor)`:

1. Policy first. `tool` names a registry object of kind `tool` with `source` `exec:<absolute binary
   path>`, registered by the operator; an unregistered name is refused before anything touches the
   disk. `tool.check(actor, tool)` must answer `allow`; `ask` and `deny` are returned as the refusal
   with the decision, so the agent's next call is `tool.request`, never a retry.
2. Materialize. A fresh run directory under the daemon's exec root receives every entry from the blob
   store with its mode; nothing else is present.
3. Sandbox. The command runs under `sandbox-exec` with a seatbelt profile compiled from a fixed
   template: default deny; read access to the run directory and to the toolchain roots listed in the
   `[exec] read_roots` config; write access to the run directory and one run-scoped temporary
   directory; no network; the environment is the allow-listed keys from `[exec] env` plus `HOME` set
   to the run directory; no credential of the daemon or the operator reaches the process. The binary
   is the registered absolute path, never a `PATH` lookup. The profile text is stored with the receipt
   as a digest.
4. Bound. `timeout_s` (default and maximum from config) kills the process group; stdout and stderr are
   captured to blobs up to a configured size each and truncated with a marker beyond it.
5. Capture. After exit the run directory is walked; every entry whose content changed, every new file
   and every deleted entry is recorded, changed content stored as blobs, and a result tree manifest
   written; the run directory is removed unless `keep` is set and permitted by config.
6. Receipt. One row in the pack table `exec_runs`: id, namespace, actor, tool, argv, `tree_in`,
   `tree_out`, exit code, `timed_out`, stdout and stderr references, started and finished times,
   duration, the policy decision and its source id, the profile digest. The return value is the
   receipt plus the change list. `exec.receipt(id)` and `exec.runs(actor, tool, limit)` read them.

The run never reads or writes a repository; the git verbs (ADR-182) move trees in and out of git.

## Acceptance

1. An unregistered tool name is refused before materialization: no run directory is created.
2. A registered tool with a `deny` policy is refused with `decision: deny` and the policy id; with
   `ask`, refused with `ask`; after `tool.grant`, the same call runs.
3. Materialization reproduces the tree: every entry's content and mode match; a manifest with `..`,
   an absolute path or a symlink entry is refused by `exec.tree`.
4. No network: a registered tool that opens a socket fails inside the run; the same binary outside the
   sandbox succeeds (control).
5. No writes outside the tree: a run that writes to the operator's home leaves no file there and
   reports a non-zero exit; a write inside the tree appears in the change list.
6. Timeout: a run exceeding `timeout_s` ends with `timed_out: true` and no process survives it.
7. Capture classifies added, modified and deleted paths; every reference returned resolves through
   `blob.get` to the content the run left.
8. The receipt's `tree_in`, `tree_out`, output references and profile digest match the stored
   objects; `exec.runs(actor)` lists it.

## Known rough edges

The sandbox is macOS seatbelt only; a Linux profile is a later slice. Toolchain read roots are operator
configuration and a missing root reads as a tool failure, not a policy refusal. Every run materializes
from scratch; build caches across runs are a later slice. Output caps and run retention are config,
not policy.
