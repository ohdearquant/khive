# ADR-021: Memory Pack

**Status**: accepted
**Date**: 2026-05-23
**Authors**: Ocean, lambda:khive

## Context

[ADR-013](ADR-013-note-kind-taxonomy.md) registers `memory` as a pack-extensible note kind
owned by `khive-pack-memory`. [ADR-019](ADR-019-gtd-pack.md) is the canonical
_lifecycle-shape_ pack example, demonstrating notes-as-tasks with a state machine. The
memory pack is the canonical _decay-shape_ pack example, demonstrating notes-as-memories
with salience-weighted time decay.

Memory is structurally distinct from tasks. Tasks have a deterministic state machine
(inbox → next → active → done) and pre-condition validation on transitions. Memory has no
state machine — it is created, retrieved with decay-weighted scoring, and eventually
deleted. The interesting machinery is in _retrieval_, not in _lifecycle_. Memory verbs
(`remember`, `recall`) compose differently from GTD verbs but follow the same pack
standard from [ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md).

A memory pack also has direct utility for the agent workflow: persistent salience-weighted
context that decays over time matches how agents accumulate working knowledge across
sessions. The first-class memory pack closes a gap that ad-hoc note storage cannot fill —
generic notes lack the decay column and the source-attribution edge.

### Scope

This ADR specifies the memory pack's vocabulary, verb surface, semantic contract, and
composition pattern. It does NOT prescribe specific retrieval-weight tuning beyond the
v1 defaults — recall scoring is a research surface that will iterate, and the weights
specified here are starting values, not invariants.

## Decision

### 1. One `memory` kind, `memory_type` as attribute

The pack registers a single note kind: `memory`. Both episodic and semantic memories are
stored under this kind, distinguished by a `memory_type` attribute on the note:

| Attribute     | Values                       | Default      | Storage           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `memory_type` | `"episodic"` \| `"semantic"` | `"episodic"` | `note.properties` |

| memory_type | Shape                       | Examples                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `episodic`  | Time-anchored, event-shaped | "On 2026-05-19 Ocean said prefer `uv run` over `python`" |
| `semantic`  | Abstracted, fact-shaped     | "Ocean prefers `uv run` over `python`"                   |

The distinction is **advisory, not enforced**. Nothing structurally validates that
episodic memories carry timestamps. Agents choose `memory_type` based on whether the
content is primarily event-oriented or persistent-fact-oriented; misclassification is
tolerated.

Two kinds (`episodic` and `semantic`) would force a two-search merge in `recall`,
complicate per-type retrieval branches, and gain nothing over a queryable property.

### 2. `salience` and `decay_factor`; `decay_factor` defaults to mild decay

The notes substrate carries `salience` (the primary signal used by retrieval rerank,
[ADR-012](ADR-012-retrieval-composition.md)) and `decay_factor` (per-note exponential
decay rate). The memory pack does NOT introduce new columns; it uses these substrate
fields directly:

| Wire parameter | Storage column | Default (episodic)         | Default (semantic)           |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `salience`     | `salience`     | `0.3`                      | `0.5`                        |
| `decay_factor` | `decay_factor` | `0.02` (~35-day half-life) | `0.005` (~139-day half-life) |

There is no aliasing — the wire parameter and storage column are both `salience`.

The substrate-wide `decay_factor` default is `0.0` (no decay). The memory pack handler
overrides this default to `0.01` for memory notes, so memory participates in time decay
by default while other note kinds remain unaffected.

### 3. `source` is an `annotates` edge, not a stored field

A memory's provenance — who or what produced it — is represented as an `annotates` edge
from the memory note to the source entity or note. Per [ADR-002](ADR-002-edge-ontology.md),
`annotates` is the universal note → any-substrate relation; pack-extensible endpoint
rules ([ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md)) accept any target.

The `remember` verb accepts an optional `source_id` argument. When present, the handler
creates the memory note and links it to the source via `annotates` in the same invocation.
When absent, no edge is created and the memory's provenance is unattributed.

For the common case "Ocean said X" the source is a `person` entity. For "agent X
produced this" the source is whichever entity represents the agent. For "this came from
paper Y" the source is the `document` entity. All three resolve through the same
`annotates` edge with no special-casing — provenance is queryable via
`neighbors(memory_id, relation="annotates")`.

Storing source as a free string in `properties` would couple the memory pack to a future
actor-identity ADR for the string format, and would not participate in graph traversal.
Edges are the right substrate for "this came from X" relationships.

### 4. `memory.remember` — sugar over `create` + optional `link`

```
memory.remember(content, memory_type?, salience?, decay_factor?, source_id?, tags?, namespace?)
```

Semantically equivalent to:

```
1. note_id = create(
     kind = "memory",
     content = content,
     salience = <salience | (episodic: 0.3, semantic: 0.5)>,
     decay_factor = <decay_factor | (episodic: 0.02, semantic: 0.005)>,
     properties = { memory_type: <memory_type | "episodic"> },
     tags = <tags | []>,
     namespace = namespace,
   )

2. if source_id is provided:
     link(source_id = note_id, target_id = source_id, relation = "annotates")
```

The handler validates: (a) `content` non-empty, (b) `memory_type ∈ {episodic, semantic}`
if provided, (c) `salience ∈ [0, 1]`, (d) `decay_factor >= 0`, (e) `source_id` is a
valid UUID present in the namespace.

Agents that prefer explicit CRUD are not blocked:
`create(kind="memory", salience=0.7, decay_factor=0.01, properties={"memory_type":"semantic"}, ...)`
followed by an optional `link(annotates)` produces an equivalent result.

### 5. `memory.recall` — memory-scoped retrieval with decay weighting

```
memory.recall(query, limit?, memory_type?, namespace?, min_score?)
```

A memory-scoped variant of `search(kind="note", ...)` with three behaviours that
distinguish it from generic note search:

1. **Candidate scoping.** The handler passes `kind="memory"` as the candidate filter,
   pushed into FTS5 and vector-search retrieval (not as a post-filter). In a mixed
   `kg,gtd,memory` namespace with thousands of non-memory notes, this prevents
   high-ranking non-memory notes from filling the candidate pool before any memory note
   is considered. If the underlying `search_notes` operation applies kind only as a
   post-filter, the handler implements bounded over-fetch (ceiling `limit * 20` raw
   candidates) until `limit` memory hits are collected.
2. **Decay-weighted scoring.** Each candidate's `salience` is decayed by age:
   `effective_salience = salience * exp(-decay_factor * age_days)`, where `age_days`
   is `(now - created_at) / seconds_per_day`. Decay is computed per candidate using the
   note's own `decay_factor` (allowing per-memory decay rates).
3. **Score fusion.** Final score combines the substrate's RRF hybrid score (FTS5 + vector)
   with the decayed salience and a temporal fresh-first signal:

   ```
   score = rrf_score * 0.70 + effective_salience * 0.20 + temporal * 0.10
   ```

   These weights are the v1 defaults. Per-`memory_type` overrides (heavier decay for
   episodic, plain RRF for semantic) are forward-compatible: the handler can branch on
   `properties.memory_type` without any schema change.

`memory_type` (optional) post-filters to `episodic` or `semantic` only. Default returns
both.

`min_score` truncates low-scoring matches before returning.

### 6. No `forget` verb

The pack registers no `forget`. Memory deletion uses the substrate verb:
`delete(id=<memory_uuid>)`. This is consistent with the soft-delete contract from
[ADR-014](ADR-014-curation-operations.md) — `delete` resolves the UUID to a note,
soft-deletes it, and excludes it from subsequent `recall` candidate sets.

A pack-owned `forget` would either duplicate `delete` (verb pollution) or carry different
semantics (e.g., permanent purge) that have no demonstrated need. Deferred until a
concrete use case requires it.

### 7. Pack composition

The memory pack is a thin pack over the notes substrate. It declares:

- **Vocabulary**: one note kind (`memory`); no entity kinds; no new edge endpoint rules
  (the existing `annotates` rule from the kg pack accepts any note→any-substrate target,
  which covers `memory→entity` and `memory→note` provenance edges)
- **Verbs**: `remember`, `recall`
- **Storage profile**: hot tier (same as kg/gtd packs); `default_backend="main"`
- **Requires**: `kg` (memory pack delegates CRUD to kg-pack note handlers)

The `requires = ["kg"]` field uses the inter-pack dependency mechanism from
[ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md) — boot-time check ensures `khive-pack-kg` is loaded
before `khive-pack-memory` registers.

The pack does NOT register any `KindHook` specialization. Memory notes route through the
kg pack's standard note CRUD handlers; the memory pack's verbs are convenience
constructions over those handlers.

### 8. Brain integration (forward reference)

When `khive-pack-brain` ([ADR-032](ADR-032-brain-profile-orchestration.md)) is loaded
alongside this pack, the `recall` handler consults brain's resolved profile before
running the candidate-fusion stage:

```text
memory.recall(query, …):
  1. P = brain.resolve(actor, namespace, consumer_kind="recall") on miss → defaults
  2. weights = P.config_overrides (RRF / salience / temporal weights — §5)
  3. candidates = recall_embed → recall_candidates (multi-engine if ADR-031 loaded)
  4. fused = recall_fuse(candidates, weights)
  5. emit RecallExecuted event with payload.served_by_profile_id = Some(P.id)
```

The §5 scoring formula's `0.70 / 0.20 / 0.10` weights are the **defaults**; brain's
resolved profile may override them per `(actor, namespace, consumer_kind)` binding
context (ADR-032 §10). Profiles whose `state_class` is `Bayesian` (the v1 state class
— ADR-032 §5a) supply scalar weight overrides; future LoRA-class profiles (ADR-032
§5b, gated on ADR-042) supply an adapter hook to the rerank step.

If brain is not loaded, the recall handler runs with the §5 defaults — the pack
remains fully usable in single-pack deployments.

See ADR-033 §8 for the recall pipeline's brain integration details and ADR-032
§6 for the data-flow contract.

### 9. Multiple memory pack instances

Operators may deploy multiple memory pack instances (e.g., `memory-hot` for
recent/active recall, `memory-cold` for archive). Both instances declare `kind=memory`.

Per [ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md)'s KindRoute model:

- **`memory.recall(kind="memory")`** fans out across all enabled instances; results fuse via
  backend-level RRF.
- **`memory.remember(kind="memory")`** writes to the operator-declared `primary_write_instance`
  (config). Explicit `instance="memory-cold"` overrides this (subject to auth).
- Operators MUST declare `primary_write_instance` when more than one memory instance is
  enabled — registration order is not a valid tiebreaker.

Sample config:

```yaml
packs:
  memory-hot:
    kind: memory
    db: ./hot.db
  memory-cold:
    kind: memory
    db: ./cold.db
runtime:
  kind_routing:
    memory:
      primary_write_instance: memory-hot
```

## Rationale

### Why pack-owned `remember` / `recall` instead of generic CRUD

The alternative is to strip `remember`/`recall` and force agents to use
`create(kind="memory", ...)` and `search(kind="note", note_kind="memory", ...)`. This
produces a memory pack that contributes a kind but no verbs — a vocabulary pack, not a
domain pack.

It conflicts with the precedent [ADR-019](ADR-019-gtd-pack.md) establishes. The GTD pack
introduces `assign` instead of `create(kind="task")` precisely because domain-specific
verbs are more legible, enforce preconditions that generic CRUD does not, and reflect the
pack's semantic ownership of its lifecycle.

The same logic applies here:

- `remember` validates `memory_type`, normalizes `salience` and `decay_factor`
  defaults, and creates the `annotates` edge in a single call. Generic `create` + `link`
  requires the agent to know two verbs and the precise edge relation.
- `recall` enforces the memory-only candidate scoping (preventing leak of `task` or
  `observation` notes into recall results) and applies decay weighting. Generic `search`
  has neither built in.

Neither is merely cosmetic; both encode pack-specific semantics that would otherwise be
re-implemented by every memory-using agent.

### Why one `memory` kind (not two)

An earlier draft considered separate `episodic` and `semantic` note kinds. One kind +
attribute has two advantages:

1. **Single filter at recall.** `recall` always passes `kind="memory"` as the candidate
   filter. No two-search merge. No kind-set juggling. The recall-leak bug class is fixed
   structurally.
2. **Forward-compatible per-type retrieval policy.** Future revisions may apply different
   pipelines to episodic vs. semantic (e.g., heavier time decay for episodic, plain RRF
   for semantic). With `memory_type` as an attribute, that becomes a handler-level branch
   on a property. With separate kinds, it would require coordinating two runtime queries.

The cost: callers querying through generic `search(kind="note", note_kind="memory")`
get both types mixed; filtering on `memory_type` requires a `properties.memory_type`
post-filter or use of the `recall` verb's `memory_type` argument. Acceptable.

### Why decay defaults are type-differentiated (not a flat `0.01`)

The substrate-wide default of `0.0` (no decay) is correct for note kinds where age is
not a relevance signal (e.g., decisions, references). For memory, age IS a relevance
signal — a memory from yesterday is more salient than one from a year ago, all else
equal.

Episodic memories (session events) are inherently transient. A flat `0.01` default
was revised to a type-differentiated scheme: episodic uses `0.02` (~35-day half-life)
so session context ages out faster, while semantic memories use `0.005` (~139-day
half-life) because durable facts should remain retrievable much longer. Salience
defaults follow the same logic: episodic `0.3` vs. semantic `0.5`.

Agents that want different decay characteristics override per-memory:
`memory.remember(content="...", decay_factor=0.05)` for fast-fading episodic content,
`memory.remember(content="...", decay_factor=0.0)` for permanent semantic facts.

### Why `salience` (not a separate `importance` column)

The `salience` column already exists on the notes substrate and participates in the
[ADR-012](ADR-012-retrieval-composition.md) rerank pipeline. Using `salience` directly
as both the wire parameter and storage column keeps the interface consistent across all
packs — the memory pack uses the same vocabulary as the substrate and other packs, with
no aliasing or translation layer.

An earlier draft aliased `importance` → `salience`. That alias was eliminated (2026-05-25)
to enforce a single consistent term throughout the codebase. The storage column
`notes.salience` was always canonical; the wire-level alias was the anomaly.

### Why scoring weights `0.70 / 0.20 / 0.10`

These are v1 starting values, not architectural invariants. The weights say: the
hybrid retrieval score (FTS5 + vector via RRF) is the primary signal, decayed salience
is a secondary signal, and freshness is a tertiary signal. Future research-driven
recalibration — Beta-Bernoulli posterior over recall hits, adaptive decay adjustment,
per-`memory_type` weight tables — lands in a separate ADR when the research informing
them is in place.

The weights are configurable per deployment via the pack's storage profile config
parameters (mechanism from [ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md)), not hard-coded in
handler logic.

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                                                          | Why rejected                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strip `remember`/`recall`; pack provides kind only                   | Loses domain-specific preconditions; contradicts GTD precedent; memory pack becomes a vocabulary pack with no semantic ownership.                                      |
| Two memory kinds (`episodic`/`semantic`)                             | Forces two-search merge in `recall`; complicates per-type retrieval policy; mixed-namespace recall correctness is harder.                                              |
| Separate `importance` column (aliasing `salience`)                   | Duplicate terms cause confusion; the alias was eliminated 2026-05-25 in favour of `salience` throughout.                                                               |
| Store `source` as a string in `properties`                           | Couples memory to a future actor-identity string format; not traversable via `neighbors`/`traverse`; loses the universal `annotates` edge.                             |
| Enforce `episodic`/`semantic` distinction with structural validation | Arbitrary; agents disagree on what "time-anchored" means; validation complexity outweighs the gain.                                                                    |
| `forget` as a pack-owned verb                                        | Duplicates `delete`; no demonstrated use case for distinct semantics; verb pollution.                                                                                  |
| Defer decay to v2                                                    | `decay_factor` column already exists; recall pipeline already supports decay-weighted scoring; deferring would mean memory recall is identical to generic note search. |
| Hard-code decay/scoring weights in handler                           | Loses tunability across deployments; future research recalibration would require code changes.                                                                         |

## Consequences

### Positive

- `remember`/`recall` join `assign`/`next`/`complete` as domain-specific pack verbs over
  the notes substrate. The verb surface grows coherently with each pack.
- Decay is wired from day one — agents using `recall` get age-weighted results matching
  intuitions about memory salience.
- Provenance is queryable via graph traversal (`neighbors`, `traverse`) without any new
  verb or storage.
- Per-`memory_type` retrieval policy is unblocked future work — no schema change required
  to branch the handler on `properties.memory_type`.
- The pack composes cleanly with the kg pack (delegates note CRUD), the gtd pack
  (coexists without interaction), and future packs that may use `annotates` edges as
  pack-extensible provenance.

### Negative

- The `recall` handler is slightly heavier than thin syntactic sugar — it does (a) note
  creation, (b) optional edge creation, and (c) decay-aware score fusion. The complexity
  is bounded to the pack and is the price of a substantive memory model.
- `memory_type` lives in `properties` JSON, which is not directly indexable. If
  `memory_type`-filtered recall becomes a hot path with very large memory namespaces, a
  future migration can promote it to a typed column.
- Scoring weights (`0.70 / 0.20 / 0.10`) are v1 starting values, not validated against
  any specific benchmark. Future tuning is expected.

### Neutral

- No schema migration. No DDL change. No new edge relation. No new entity kind.
  `annotates` already accepts note → any-substrate per [ADR-002](ADR-002-edge-ontology.md).
- `khive-pack-kg` is unaffected. Its `search`/`create` paths continue to work as
  specified; the memory pack uses them via the runtime's pack-extensible verb dispatch.
- The pack composes with [ADR-020](ADR-020-git-native-kg-implementation.md) git-native
  KG: memory notes are part of the notes substrate, which is excluded from v1 KG
  snapshots ([ADR-010](ADR-010-kg-versioning.md) §SnapshotCoverage). Memory persists in
  `working.db` and the main database; cross-instance memory portability is v2 work.

## Implementation

### Pack manifest

```rust
// crates/khive-pack-memory/src/lib.rs
pub struct MemoryPack;

impl Pack for MemoryPack {
    const NAME: &'static str = "memory";
    const NOTE_KINDS: &'static [&'static str] = &["memory"];
    const ENTITY_KINDS: &'static [&'static str] = &[];
    const EDGE_RULES: &'static [EdgeEndpointRule] = &[];
    const HANDLERS: &'static [HandlerDef] = &[
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.remember",          description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Verb },
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.recall",            description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Verb },
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.recall_embed",      description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Subhandler },
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.recall_candidates", description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Subhandler },
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.recall_fuse",       description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Subhandler },
        HandlerDef { name: "memory.recall_score",      description: "...", visibility: Visibility::Subhandler },
    ];
    // ADR-023 §4: pack-prefixed verb names — `memory.remember` / `memory.recall` (Verb)
    //             `memory.recall_embed` / `memory.recall_candidates` / `memory.recall_fuse` / `memory.recall_score` (Subhandler)
    const REQUIRES: &'static [&'static str] = &["kg"];
}
```

The pack's `StorageProfile` (from [ADR-003](ADR-003-system-architecture.md) /
[ADR-017](ADR-017-pack-standard.md)) is `hot` with `default_backend="main"`.

### Handler responsibilities

`remember`:

- Validate inputs (content non-empty, memory_type ∈ {episodic, semantic}, salience ∈ [0,1])
- Construct `Note` via the storage builder with `salience`, `decay_factor`,
  `properties.memory_type`
- Persist via `runtime.create_note(...)`
- If `source_id`: validate it exists in the namespace; create `annotates` edge

`recall`:

- Build candidate request with `kind="memory"` as candidate filter (push into FTS5/vector
  candidate retrieval, not just post-filter)
- For each candidate: compute `effective_salience = salience * exp(-decay_factor * age_days)`,
  apply score fusion formula
- Apply optional `memory_type` post-filter
- Apply `min_score` truncation, then `limit`

| `memory_type` post-filter                                       | Returns only specified type                                                 |
| `delete(memory_id)` works without forget verb                   | Subsequent recall excludes the deleted memory                               |
